# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

#create seed data here e.g:

# db/seeds.rb
# Animal.create(name: "Lion", Location: "Amboseli", Ranger_name: "Kisavi")
# Animal.create(name: "baboon", Location: "Mara", Ranger_name: "Andrea")
# Animal.create(name: "hyena", Location: "Amboseli", Ranger_name: "Micahel")
# Animal.create(name: "porcupine", Location: "Tsavo", Ranger_name: "Simon")

# Endangered_Animal.create(name: "White Rhino", Location: "Amboseli", age: "newborn", health: "Healthy")
# Endangered_Animal.create(name: "Chipanzee", Location: "Mara", age: "adult", health: "Ill")
# Endangered_Animal.create(name: "Elepphant", Location: "Amboseli", age: "young", health: "Okay")
# Endangered_Animal.create(name: " white girraffe", Location: "Tsavo", age: "newborn", health: "Healthy")
